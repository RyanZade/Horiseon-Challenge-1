# Horiseon-Challenge-1
The challenge required students to complete the "on-the-job" challenge meaning a starter code needed to be modified to meet certain acceptance criteria.

The html shows a page made for a marketing agency that has a code that follows accessiblity standards so that the site is optimised for search engines.
CSS files were used for site accessabilty and looks. 

  Contents:
    - HTML File
    - Assets Folder
      - Images
      - CSS file

The HTML file should be accessable from the https link: https://ryanzade.github.io/Horiseon-Challenge-1/
